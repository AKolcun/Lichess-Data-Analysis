# Lichess-Data-Analysis

This project analyzes Chess game data pulled from Lichess, specifically all games recorded for January 2016. The goal was to set up a toy database in MySQL, run through
some exploratory analysis using queries, and create some interesting visuals. The gifs below are examples from the analysis, full code with commentary can be found in 
Jupyter notebook.
